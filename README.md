Hey Day Script

** Synopsis **
Hey Day is a tradition at Auburn University that pushes for every student to feel welcome and at home on campus. This tradition began from WWII veterans who came home from war and felt unseen. This made Auburn jump into action so that no one would feel that way again! This tradition involves nametags that are handed out to everyone on campus, and a friendly greeting at each stand throughout the massive campus. This code is to recreate that feeling and action that Auburn produces on Hey Day.

** Example Code **
``` ruby
require 'echo'
markdown = echo ""
print out any phrase using the echo command
```
``` ruby
require 'read'
markdown = read name
allow an interactive interface for the user to input what they choose
```
